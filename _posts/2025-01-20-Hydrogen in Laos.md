Last year, I completed my <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13897880">master's thesis</a> and subsequently spent the next several months preparing it for publication. This process primarily involved enhancing the content and conducting further analyses that were beyond my initial thesis work, such as examining electricity demand and runoff variability. 

Prior to my trip to Laos for the presentation for the Ministry of Energy and Mines, I sought a more intuitive method to present the different scenarios and devoted a few days to developing a Streamlit website for visualization.
